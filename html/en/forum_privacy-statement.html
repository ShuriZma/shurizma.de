                <p><br></p>
                <p>The data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find his contact data in the imprint of this website. </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Your data will be collected, on the one hand, by you communicating it to us. This can be data that you enter in a contact form, for example.</p>

                <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and according to the legal data protection regulations as well as this data protection explanation.</p>
                <p><br></p>

                    Note on the responsible body
                </h3>
                <p>The entity responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Markus Heß<br />
                    An der Wuhlheide 148<br />

                <h3>
                    Revocation of your consent to data processing
                </h3>
                <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. For this purpose, an informal e-mail notification to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
                <h3>
                    Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)
                </h3>
                <p><strong>If data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO, you have the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which a processing is based can be found in this data protection declaration. If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data concerned unless we can prove compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims (objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO).</strong></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p><strong>If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for the purpose of direct advertising (objection according to Art. 21 para. 2 DSGVO).</strong></p>
                <h3>
                    Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority
                </h3>
                <p>In the event of infringements of the DSGVO, the persons concerned have the right to appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, workplace or place of presumed infringement. The right of appeal shall be without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>
                <h3>
                    Right to data transferability
                </h3>
                <p>You have the right to have data which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible person, this will only be done as far as it is technically feasible.</p>
                <h3>
                    Information, blocking, deletion and correction
                </h3>
                <p>You have the right within the scope of the valid legal regulations at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and receiver and the purpose of the data processing and if necessary a right to correction, blockage or deletion of these data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint for this and other questions on the subject of personal data.</p>
                <h3>
                    Right to limitation of processing
                </h3>
                <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction of the processing exists in the following cases: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the check, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                    <li>If the processing of your personal data happened / happens unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defence or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
                    <li>If you have filed an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Para. 1 DSGVO, you must weigh your interests against ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests predominate, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data may only be processed - apart from its storage - with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

                <p>The Internet pages partly use so-called cookies. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and safer. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p> Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our site.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>You can set your browser so that you are informed when cookies are set and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when you close your browser. When cookies are disabled, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Cookies, which are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process or for the provision of certain functions desired by you (e.g. shopping basket function), are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a justified interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of his services. As far as other cookies (e.g. cookies for the analysis of your surfing behaviour) are stored, these will be treated separately in this privacy policy.
                <h3>
                    Server log files
                </h3>
                <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                    <li>operating system used</li>
                    <li>Referrer URL</li>
                    <li>host name of the accessing computer</li>
                    <li>Time of the server request</li>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A merging of this data with other data sources is not performed.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>These data are collected on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a justified interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website - for this the server log files must be recorded.
                <h3>
                    contact form
                </h3>
                <p>If you send us enquiries via the contact form, your details from the enquiry form including the contact data you entered there will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event of follow-up questions. These data will not be passed on without your consent. </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore carried out exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke this consent at any time. For this purpose, an informal notification by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation shall remain unaffected by the revocation.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>The data entered by you in the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected. </p>
